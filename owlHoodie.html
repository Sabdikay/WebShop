 In this last task you must implement the pages for the products that you have. Each product must
have an individual page with detailed information. In this task it is sufficient, if you implement a
product’s page for one example product of your web-shop, e.g., sneakerMax203.
It is up to you what kind of information you are aiming to present in this task but you will definitely
need a button to add this product to the shopping cart. The shopping cart itself will be implemented
in later exercise sheets.
