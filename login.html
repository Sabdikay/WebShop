Implement a view for usersâ€™ login. The corresponding form should offer two input options. With the
first input the username should be requested while the second input requests a valid password from
the user. Each field should be displayed in a line with a corresponding label.
In addition, two buttons are necessary. The first button navigates to the registration form
(registration.html) and the second button should send the entered values to the server. The server
may check the input (not in this exercise sheet!).
