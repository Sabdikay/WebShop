If the user is not yet registered, a registration form should be used to create a user account. The form
should offer three input options. With the first entry, the username should be entered, the second
and the third entries, the password and the confirmation of the password should be requested.
Each field should be displayed in a line with the corresponding label. In addition, two buttons are to
be created. The first button should give the option to cancel the input and navigate back to the login
form. The second button allows to send the entered values to the server.
The server may check the input (not in this exercise sheet!).
