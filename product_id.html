have an individual page with detailed information. In this task it is sufficient, if you implement a
productâ€™s page for one example product of your web-shop, e.g., sneakerMax203.
It is up to you what kind of information you are aiming to present in this task but you will definitely
need a button to add this product to the shopping cart. The shopping cart itself will be implemented
in later exercise sheets.
